## A02 Open MP - Getting started
#### Due: 02-18-2020 (Tuesday @ 5:30 p.m.)

### Overview

- I found an interesting blog post here: https://austingwalters.com/cache-optimizing/ talking about optimizing code to not cause cache misses. 
- Since we need to get on with threading, we need a good starter project.
- Here is the github repo from the blogpost: https://github.com/lettergram/Cache-Comparison
- I've included a copy of a paper referenced in the blogpost in [Informed Prefetching](informed_prefetching.pdf) which is a concept still in application today. 

### Deliverables

- Get OpenMP running on your individual work computers.
- Create your own results by running Mr. Walters code on your own machines. They should differ based on architecture. 
- Create a csv file and place on your github repo under your assignments folder in a folder labeled `A02`.
- Make sure all the code you used is there as well. 
- If you clone the Cache-Comparison repo from github, delete the `.git` folder within that folder (not yours!)
