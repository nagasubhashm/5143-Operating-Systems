[ [ **Distributed system on One Lane Bridge** ]{style="color: #0000ff;"}
project idea is to provide solution for vehicles coming from different
 direction to cross one lane bridge.
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}

[ Develop a server process to manage use of the bridge. Assume the cars
are client processes that can
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ remotely
get connect to the server at any time.
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}

[ In your simulation program, have new cars join in the session remotely
and each car repeatedly try to
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ cross
the bridge. They should spend a random amount of time on the bridge and
should delay for a
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ random
amount of time before crossing again. Each car client can specify some
parameters such as its
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ speed,
average delaying time after crossing, initial heading direction etc.
Ideally, each client should get a
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [
graphical interface showing the current status on the bridge
utilization.

[ [ **Implement a stock market simulation game**
]{style="color: #0000ff;"} for several human players and several
computer players.
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ You are
to create a fast-paced on-line interactive game of stock market, which
has many of the
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [
characteristics of electronic commerce. The entities in the game are a
bank, a stock exchange, several
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [
companies and several players. The time between events has been
significantly accelerated to make the
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ game
more challenging and interesting.
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}

[ **Bank** : The one bank holds the cash of any player.
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}\
[ A player can request a new account, deposit and withdraw money from
the account. The bank has a
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ maximum
of 10 accounts. Once every minute during the game, all money in an
account accumulates 1%
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [
interest. ]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}

[ **Company** : A company has a name and issues stock. Once a minute,
the company's price of the stock is
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ adjusted
based on a random process and the law of supply and demand. Initially
each company has 1000
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ shares
of stock, which starts at \$30 a share. There are several companies for
example three to ten in the
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ game. A
company buys or sells shares to a player by accepting or rejecting the
player's bid. The process
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ of
deciding to accept or reject may be random or based on sound business
practices. ]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}

[ **Player** : There can be two types of players -- human and computer.
A player starts with \$1000 and buys and
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ sells
stock from companies or other players by trading through the stock
exchange. The goal of a player is
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ to make
money. A player buys or sells shares from another player or a company by
posting bids on the
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ stock
exchange. The company or the other player may accept or reject the
player's bid. The process of
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ deciding
how the computer-based player accepts or rejects may be random or based
on sound business
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [
practices. There are two to ten players.
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}

[ **Stock Exchange** : Players and companies must register with the
stock exchange. All trading of stocks must
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ go
through the centralized stock exchange. The stock exchange posts current
bids and the prices of recent
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [
transactions on each stock.
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}

[ The winner is the player with the highest total value in cash and
stock value after a certain period of time.
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ Of
course, a player can not buy shares of stock that don't exist and he or
she must have enough cash to
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ purchase
the desired shares. The bank, stock exchange, companies and computer
players are trusted
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [
entities, i.e., they don't cheat.
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}

[Final Year Distributed System Project Idea on Replicated File System](https://1000projects.org/final-year-distributed-system-project-idea-on-replicated-file-system.html) {#final-year-distributed-system-project-idea-on-replicated-file-system .entry-title}

[ [ **Replicated file Distributed system project idea**
]{style="color: #0000ff;"} explains a simple way to increase the
likelihood that a critical data file is always
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [
accessible is to keep a back-up copy of the file on another disk,
usually one that is attached to a different
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ machine.
The file system provides transparent replication. In particular, suppose
there are n copies of a
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ data
file and n server modules. Each server provides access to one copy of
the file. A client interacts with
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ any one
of the server modules. The servers interact with each other to present
clients with the illusion that
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ there is
a single copy of the file. Each file exports four operations: open,
close, read and write for client.
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ The file
servers interact with each other to ensure that copies of the file are
kept consistent and that at
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ most one
client at a time is permitted to write into the file. Each file servers
has a local lock manager
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ process
that implements a solution to the readers/writer problem. Some points to
bear in mind.
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [\
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}

[ **a.** Each fileserver exports two sets of operations: those called by
its clients and those called by other
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ file
servers. Each server module keeps track of current access mode by using
a lock manager. For example,
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ the file
is not written if it was opened for reading. Multiple readings however
are allowed. If a certain
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [
operation needs to get permission from all lock managers, please acquire
the locks in the same order for
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [ all
clients. Otherwise, deadlock may occur.
]{style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: medium;"}

[ **b.** Within write procedure, a module first update its local copy
then concurrently updates every remote
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}\
[ copy. It is analogous to using a write-through cache update policy. An
alternative approach would be to
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}\
[ update the remote copy when the file is closed.
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}

[ **Demo purpose:** Store duplicated simple text files in several
fileservers for demo purpose. Write operation
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}\
[ just simply appends more text to the file. Client gets connected to
any fileserver in a graphical user
]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"} [
interface. ]{style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia, palatino;"}
